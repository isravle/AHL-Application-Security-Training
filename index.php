<h2>Welcome to AHL Application Security Training v1.0</h2>
<p>My name is Aviv Avraham Levy,</p>
<br>
I created this training for people who want to test and learn the most common application vulnerabilities.<br>
From time to time I will update new versions which contain new vulnerabilities, and I will appreciate if you ask for specific vulnerabilities and report for any kind of bugs.<br>
<br>
The solution for each challenge can be found in the bottom of the source code inside HTML comment.<br>
